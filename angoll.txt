A responsive website is a website designed with an approach that aims to provide an optimal appearance - easy readability, simple navigation with as little resizing and scrolling as possible - on a wide variety of devices (from desktop monitors to mobile phones). The basic problem is that different devices have different screen sizes. And these different sizes can really mess up the website, while responsive websites can help us solve these problems by adjusting-resizing the website.
The first thing visitors focus on a website is how it looks, so it's important to have a stunning-cool looking website no matter what device the customer is using. Using responsive website can easily solve this problem because by basics there are way too many different devices and screen sizes for someone to make something look good on all of them, but responsive sites offer the chance to readjust the website depending on the users devices.
Website developers can use the built-in device in browsers to preview how the website would look on different screen sizes. They have to be aware to use percentages instead of fix pixels. The developers need to use HTML,CSS or JQuery. Bootstrap is one of the most popular frameworks to create responsive websites with.
