Dear Mr Davis,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inquire about the part-time job opportunity at your insurance company. I am very interested in joining your team and believe my skills and experience would be a valuable asset to your organization.

As a student, I am looking for a part-time job that can accommodate my academic schedule while also providing me with an opportunity to gain hands-on experience in the industry. I am particularly drawn to your company due to its reputation for providing excellent customer service and its commitment to growth and development.

I would greatly appreciate if you could provide me with some information about the position. Specifically, I was wondering how many shifts I would be expected to work per week and what their duration would be. Additionally, I would like to know when I need to send my application and where the interview will be held.

Thank you for considering my inquiry. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss my qualifications and interest in this position.

Best regards,
Szabolcs
