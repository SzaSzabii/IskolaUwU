Dear Editor
I am writing to discuss the current use of technology in schools and some of the issues that arise from it. In recent years, the use of technology in the classroom has increased dramatically, providing students with new and innovative ways to learn. However, despite its many benefits, there are still several problems that need to be addressed.

One of the biggest issues is the lack of adequate infrastructure and funding. Schools often struggle to provide students with the latest technology and hardware, leading to outdated and unreliable systems. This results in students being unable to access the tools they need to succeed, and teachers being unable to effectively integrate technology into their lessons.To improve the use of educational technology in schools, it is essential to address these challenges. One solution would be to increase funding for technology initiatives, to ensure that schools have the resources they need to provide students with the latest technology and training.

In conclusion, while technology has the potential to transform education, it is important to address the challenges that arise from its use. By investing in infrastructure and training, we can ensure that all students have equal access to the tools they need to succeed. Thank you for taking the time to read this letter, and I look forward to discussing these issues with you further.

Sincerely,
Szabolcs
